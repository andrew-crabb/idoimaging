    <h1>News From I Do Imaging</h1>
    <h2>New Mail Format</h2>
    <p>If you've received email updates before you'll certainly notice
      that the format has changed. Emails are now in full HTML and we're
      using an email provider to make subscribing and unsubscribing
      easier. We're adding a short section 'Notable Releases',
      highlighting some significant updates that have been released
      since the last email, and a sidebar with a quick mention of all
      the projects that have released a new version in the same period.
      This is a good way to find great programs that you may not have
      known about. The 'Notable Releases' and sidebar content are
      archived in the <a href="http://www.idoimaging.com/blog">I Do
        Imaging Blog</a>, so if you don't get an email because none of
      the projects you follow have released an update, you can read the
      updates there. </p>
    The updates you receive still contain the updates on programs you
    are interested in and selected to follow. <br>
