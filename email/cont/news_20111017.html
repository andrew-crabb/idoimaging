      <h2>New Mail Format</h2>
      <p>If you've received email updates before you'll certainly notice
        that the format has changed.&nbsp; Emails are now in full HTML
        and we're using an email provider to make subscribing and
        unsubscribing easier.&nbsp; We're adding a short section
        'Notable Releases', highlighting some significant updates that
        have been released since the last email, and a sidebar with a
        quick mention of all the projects thathave released a new
        version in the same period.&nbsp; This is a good way to find
        great programs that you may not have known about.&nbsp; The
        'Notable Releases' and sidebar content are archived in the <a
          href="www.idoimaging.com/blog">I Do Imaging Blog</a>, so if
        you don't get an email because none of the projects you follow
        have released an update, you can read the updates there. </p>
      <p>The updates you receive still contain the upates on programs
        you are interested in and selected to follow.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <h2>Notable Releases</h2>
      <p>There are a large number of updates to cover since the last
        email, we've been busy implementing the new features!<br>
