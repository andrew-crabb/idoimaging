Quick Instructions for Most Servers (Apache on Linux, Mac OS X, BSD):

If your server doesn't already have MySQL installed, download and install the
free MySQL Community Server from www.mysql.com.  Once it's installed, create
a database and a MySQL user account: www.encodable.com/database_setup

Upload the contents of the www.example.com folder onto your website.  Then
visit the following address, replacing example.com with your own domain name:

	www.example.com/cgi-bin/userbase.cgi

If you see a message about adjusting database prefs, then UserBase is working
properly.  You should now read the FAQ:	www.encodable.com/userbase/faq

Quick Instructions for Apache-on-Windows Servers:

If your server doesn't already have Perl installed, download and install the
free ActivePerl from www.activestate.com.  You may need to reboot after
installing it.  Open a command prompt and type   perl -v   and if you get some
output about Perl and its version info, you should be all set.

If you had to install Perl, you'll also need to install the DBD::MySQL Perl
module (and probably the MIME::Lite module) by opening the Run dialog or a
command prompt and then typing   ppm install DBD-mysql   (and then
ppm install MIME-Lite).  Or you can run just the ppm command by itself to
use the graphical installer. 

Now follow the regular Apache instructions above.
