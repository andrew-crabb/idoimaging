		     BIG IDEAS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1a. Test data database - hosted by me. This could be in the form of a
   PACS.  Users can submit data securely which will be anonymized. Can
   I run open ports (either low or high numbered) on an ISP?  If not I
   may have to lease a co-host machine with open ports.
1b. Test data database - those hosted on sites.  Rated by download
   speed, availability.  Classified by image format, format details
   (endian, version), species, anatomy, image dimension.  Store
   identifiers (size, name, md5) to eliminate duplicates.
1c. Add program link: Recommended test data for this program.

2. Re-implement site in the form of static pages generated daily, for
   the benefit of search engines.  Currently all pages have the same
   page title.

3. Cache distributions under existing license.  If the license is
   changed and the product made commercial, it is still legal to
   distribute the old program under its existing license.

4. Blog.  I Blog Imaging.  Get these thoughts down!  Communicate with
   your users! 

5. PACS feature: Training.  Make it easy for people (med students etc)
   to install a PACS client and practice diagnoses.  I could code a
   program that allows an expert to record, movie-like, comments and
   cursor movements.

6 How-tos and quick starts.  FAQs (IAQs? FUQs?).  I Learn Imaging.
  School of Imaging.  How to view/convert an image.  How to identify
  an image.  How to do a cool 3D rendering.  How to anonymize or edit
  various well known formats.  How to identify an unknown file (eg
  size, magic numbers, endian).  Just Enough CS (number systems,
  scaling, memory allocation, file sizes, endian-ness).  Four
  categories: (1) Patient seeking to view own scans; (2) Developer;
  (3) Clinical user; (4) Research user.  FAQs for authors - how to
  make project trackable, what makes a project popular, etc.

7. File identification service (this ties in with medimageworks).
   What's my image.  Stump the chump.

8. Multi-level menus.  Might need Flash.  IE: Nobody uses the Finder.
   Make it more prominent.

9. Video tutorial showing intro features etc.

10. Inactive programs are listed as such - 'Missing in Action' -
    together with dates last heard from.  Needs a database flag.

11. Need an automated way of downloading and archiving model data
    sets.

12. Offer hosting for projects.  This would be as a subdomain:
    readpet.idoimaging.com.  Check with Pair plans to see how many of
    these domains I can host, also how I can control disk usage and
    bandwidth usage.  Projects would be "readPET: An independent
    project by Andrew Crabb, hosted by idoimaging.com".

13. Apply for an equipment grant: Apple (stress application of Apple
    hardware), Sun (stress Java projects).

14. Incorporate your company!  Register as Medical Image Works.
    www.medimageworks.com

		     THINGS TO DO AND FIX
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

9/22/06  Bug fixes and additions.

1. programs.pl not sorting by page after search.  Variable scoping
   problem fixed.

2. programs.pl - Added sort order indication.

3. Get the sort-order column headings from listversions, add it to the
   library, and use it in the other listings.

4. File formats to add: FreeSurfer

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		     ADDITIONAL FEATURES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Rating: Weighted formula.

1. Web ranking (Google page rank).	10
2. Click-to ranking on IDI		10
3. Tracking ranking on IDI		10
4. Ease of download/access		10
5. Project activity count		10
6. Andyrank: Overall quality		20
7. Andyrank: Ease of installation	 5
8. Andyrank: Documentation/website	10
9. Andyrank: Usefulness/Applicability	10
10.Andyrank: Project activity		 5

1a. Rating metric: Ease of access.
   1 = Go ahead and download it.
   2 = Fill in form, no verification, then download.
   3 = Fill in form, wait for human verification.
1b. Rating metric: Procect Activity.
   This could be 50% updates and 50% my opinion (some projects release
   trivial updates).
1c. Rating metric: Andy's Rating.
1d. Rating metric: Documentation.
1e. Indicate those projects with a good/entertaining website.
1f. Ease of installation/use: Beginner, Intermediate, Expert.

4. Quick Links - make it easy for people to find the 20% of programs
   that form 80% of the search requests.  IE: DICOM viewer in PC (3),
   Mac (2), Unix (2).  PACS server & client in 3 platforms.

5. Add 'View Full List' to 'quick links' on front page - links to
   Finder with platform, function, input format etc defined.

6. Need to be able to express the concept of a suite of software, but
   give it extra emphasis so it comes to the top of searches.  Many
   programs that are too small to be listed on their own
   (dicomdirexplorer, opendicom.net, LONI, UNC etc).

7. New category: distribution format (ie include RPMs for different
   Unixes, Debian, source, Win executables, Mac dmg etc).

8. New functionality: Anonymizer.

9. Administrative features.  1. Delete program altogether, or flag it
   so it does not appear.  Remove all trackers of this program.
   2. Merge a program into another program, and edit its trackers so
   they now track the new program.  Add a note to it that this was
   done. 

10. New category for 'quick favorites': header dump / meta-info view.

11. New relationship between programs: 'formerly'.  This is how you
    can establish a program's lineage.  Relationship is many to many:
    A and B can become C, or D can become E and F.  This also allows
    you to redirect trackers, and produce a subtitle.  It can be
    chained - c, formerly B, itself formerly A - by following a chain
    of links.

12. Subcategorization of viewing - single frame, multi frame,
    lightbox, orthogonal, volume, surface, crop.

13. Statistically analyze search.log to see what it is that people are
    looking for.  This is a case for longer descriptions!  Improved
    search abilities are important.  Google business search is
    available for $100 for 5,000 pages, and is customizable and ad
    free, but my content is all on a searchable database!  I should be
    able to find a php application that does a good search.  MySQL has
    'full text search' ability - is there a Perl module for this?

MISCELLANEOUS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML <head> Title

This is defined in 3 places:

1. index.html which immediately redirects to index.shtml.  However it
   may be picked up as a key file by a crawler and as such is
   important. 

2. head.shtml is included from index.shtml.  Ths is the only static
   HTML that defines the HTML <title> attribute.

3. radutils::printStartHTML() is called by each program that generates
   a page of HTML.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Static HTML files require index_head.shtml to be included.  These are
about.shtml, admin.shtml, index.shtml, programs.shtml.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
			 Check these programs

SimpleDICOM has been taken off - see if you can get a distribution.

Remove all vestiges of AccuLite.

Rearrange Julius.

Merge BrainVisa and Anatomist.

MySQL: You can use 'AS' to shorten table names:
mysql> SELECT E.entryID, E.title, C.name
    -> FROM blog_entries AS E, blog_categories AS C
    -> WHERE E.categoryID=C.categoryID AND
    ->       MATCH (E.title, E.entry) AGAINST ('michigan') AND
    ->       E.categoryID=1;
