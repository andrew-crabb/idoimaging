      If you have an account at I Do Imaging created before March 2012, log in with your email address, without a password.  You will be asked to create a new password.
    </p>
    <p>
      Logging in to I Do Imaging using an account you have created, allows you to create a list of programs you are interested in.  We send occasional emails (fewer than one per month) with information on programs on your list that have released new versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've changed the login system, which now requires that you specify a password.  You still log in with your email address, but you will be asked to specify a password for future logins.  You will retain the existing list of programs you are monitoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this new system, we will be able to expand the services we offer.  Next up: Saved Searches.  You will be able to save the parameters of searches that interest you (such as "Macintosh programs that can read Dicom and specalize in neuro imaging").
