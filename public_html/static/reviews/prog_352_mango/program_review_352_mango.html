<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>
<img style="width: 41px; height: 41px;" alt="Mango Icon"
 src="resources/app_icon.png" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5">Mango
is a stable and highly capable Java-based medical image viewer
developed at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San
Antonio.&nbsp;
It is easy to use for small jobs but has a feature list
that includes surface and volume rendering, command-line mode for power
users and scripting, ROI editing and analysis, and sophisticated image
processing and filtering.&nbsp; For the programmer, a plugin API is
available to extend the program's capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most
users will use it as a DICOM viewer though it also supports NIFTI, NEMA
and Analyze file formats, and a flexible raw data input mode which
allows complete low-level control of the image data being read
in.&nbsp; It's available on all platforms and has a full installer to
get you started quickly.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="website"></a>Website</h2>
<p>
Mango have a comprehensive and well designed web site.&nbsp; Some of
the downloads available include:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Plugin extensions for the program</li>
  <li>Sample test data.</li>
  <li>API for developing plugins to extend the program.</li>
  <li>Applet for displaying images on a web page.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
The site has a very comprehensive revision history describing the
changes at each new version.<br>
<h2><a name="getting"></a>Getting The Software</h2>
<p>
Link to the program site through the <a
 href="http://www.idoimaging.com/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/acrabb/imaging/program.pl?ident=352">I
Do
Imaging</a> page for the program, as the links are regularly tested
and updated if necessary.&nbsp; This program is available for direct
download from UTHSC - there's nothing to fill out or wait for approval,
though there's an option to add your email for notification of
updates.&nbsp; Of course, you can also add this program to those you're
monitoring on I Do Imaging, so you'll receive emails when this or any
other of your tracked programs have been updated.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h2>
<p>
The program downloaded quickly and is available in three standard
installation formats: a Windows Installer Package, Macintosh disk image
(DMG), and a Linux zip file.&nbsp; As the program is supplied as a Java
Archive (JAR) file, the installer only needs to copy this file to a
supplied location, and add a small script or program to start Java
running on the JAR file.&nbsp; On the Mac and Linux platforms, this is
a very short shell script, whereas on Windows it is a short compiled
file.&nbsp; Still, having the installer do this step for you is a nice
touch.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>Standard locations are suggested as an installation
location; I override these as I like to keep all my imaging programs
separate from other programs on my machines.&nbsp; On Windows I install
most imaging programs to <span
 style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">C:\imaging</span>;
on the Linux and Mac platforms I install to <span
 style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">/usr/local</span>
or to a directory <span
 style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">imaging</span> in
my home directory.&nbsp; This caused a small problem with the Mac
installer, since the startup script was hard coded to expect the
application directory to be called Mango and be in my home
directory.&nbsp; I edited the startup script to reflect the location of
the Mango directory, and all was well.&nbsp; A nice addition to the
installer script would be to accommodate changing the name and location
of the application directory.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="input"></a>Input Data</h2>
Mango can read data in <a
 href="http://www.idoimaging.com/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/acrabb/imaging/formats.pl?ident=2">DICOM</a>
format, also <a
 href="http://www.idoimaging.com/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/acrabb/imaging/formats.pl?ident=17179869184">NIFTI</a>,
<a
 href="http://www.idoimaging.com/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/acrabb/imaging/formats.pl?ident=8">Analyze</a>,
and
<a
 href="http://www.idoimaging.com/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/acrabb/imaging/formats.pl?ident=4">NEMA</a>.&nbsp;
If
you
recognize
the
last three, you probably know what they are and
whether you need these file formats.&nbsp; We'll concentrate on the
DICOM format files.&nbsp; Mango also has the ability to have new file
formats added to its core functionality through the use of add-on
plugin modules.&nbsp; This is an extremely useful feature for the
advanced user working with uncommon file formats.<br>
<br>
If you open a DICOM file, Mango will scan through the directory that
file is in, and open the whole volume.&nbsp; There is a list of
recently-opened files in the File menu, though it lists only the name
of the opened file or directory.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="resources/capture5.png"><img
 alt="Image Browser" title="Image Browser" src="resources/capture5.png"
 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 364px; height: 300px;" hspace="3"
 vspace="3"></a></span><br>
</div>
Mango has several very useful advanced DICOM
file-level features.&nbsp; The
Image Browser opens a file browser window that shows a summary of the
name of each data series, along with its major dimensions and
orientation, and a more detailed summary and preview image of the
currently selected series.<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;
You can open multiple tabs in the browser, each of which shows the
studies in a particular location.&nbsp; These settings are preserved
between sessions, making it a useful place to bookmark favorite
directories.<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="resources/capture1.png"><img
 alt="DICOM folder" title="DICOM folder" src="resources/capture1.png"
 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 505px; height: 200px;" hspace="3"
 vspace="3"></a><br>
</div>
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"></span>When you open a DICOM
directory, Mango scans through its subdirectories
and determines which series are contained within it.&nbsp; The list of
series is then presented so one may be opened.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="resources/capture0.png"><img
 alt="Raw data" title="Raw data" src="resources/capture0.png"
 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 300px; height: 377px;" hspace="3"
 vspace="3"></a><br>
</div>
Mango also has the very useful ability to read in data as a raw stream
of bytes, and allows you to specify the full range of parameters for
loading these volumes.&nbsp; These include the voxel counts and
dimensions, also datatype sizing (8 through 32 bit), parity, ordering,
and encoding.&nbsp; This ability is invaluable when trying to read a
file in an unknown format, or raw binary voxel data from an image
file.&nbsp; This feature alone makes the program worth using, if you
work with files at the byte level.<br>
<h2><a name="viewing"></a>Viewing and Rendering</h2>
Image volumes once loaded, are displayed in a standard orthoganal
view in a window which cannot be dragged to resize, but can be zoomed
using a zoom in/out option in the 'Window' menu.&nbsp; There are a wide
range of controls for adjusting the image
levels and colors.&nbsp; Multiple volumes may be opened at the same
time and there is an option to sync navigation between the
volumes.&nbsp; However when I tested this using different MRI series
from the same scanning session, although the navigation in each volume
was simultaneous, the navigation point was different in the two
volumes. <br>
<br>
<h4>Advanced Viewing Functions</h4>
Transformations (scaling, rotations, translations) can be entered
manually or loaded from a file.&nbsp; This is particularly useful when
co-registering several different scans in the same or different
modalities.&nbsp; A stored transformation matrix file could be applied,
for instance, to several physically co-registered image volumes to
bring them into the same orientation.&nbsp; The orientation can be
reversed along all three axes, and the image origin can be manually
redefined.<br>
<br>
Overlays are supported: applying one image on top of, or in the same
space as another.&nbsp; When I tested this feature I could get two
identical image volumes (such as two PET scans taken several minutes
apart) to overlay, but two volumes in different resolutions (such as a
CT in 512x512 and a PET in 128x128 resolution) did not appear in
co-registration although their image coordinate space was in
registration.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="extensibility"></a>Extensibility</h2>
One of Mango's great strengths is its plugin architecture.&nbsp; This
allows software developers to write modules to add functionality to the
program.&nbsp; A number of plugins are supplied on the web site, and a
programmer's API is available for developing further modules.&nbsp;
Examples of plugin modules include adding the ability to run the
program from the command line to convert images between various
formats, or to rescale or concatenate images.&nbsp; Other available
plugins add advanced features such as an anatomical atlas and surface
rendering.&nbsp; Plugins can also be developed to allow the import of
file formats not currently supported by the program.&nbsp; The
extensible plugin architecture is a major feature of Mango and will
increase its usefulness, particularly if the developer community
continue to contribute new plugins.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="analysis"></a>Analysis</h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a style="font-style: italic;"
 href="resources/capture6.png"><img alt="ROI" title="ROI"
 src="resources/capture6.png"
 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 180px; height: 290px;" hspace="3"

 title="Calculator" src="resources/capture8.png"
 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 210px; height: 290px;" hspace="3"
 vspace="3"></a><br>
</div>
Mango has a very extensive set of ROI and VOI tools including the
ability to import and export ROIs, perform logical operations on ROIs,
gather statistics, and numerous other tools.&nbsp; ROIs and VOIs can be
defined through drawing directly using graphics primitives, tracing, or
thresholding.&nbsp; Wand tools allow regions to be defined
semi-automatically using seed points in 2D and 3D, and once defined can
be edited by hand or by tools such as dilation/erosion.&nbsp; This is a
highly advanced feature that has much more capability than I have
described here.<br>
<br>
Another very powerful tool is the Image Calculator.&nbsp; This tool
performs arbitrary calculations between any open volume, slice, or
ROI.&nbsp; Images may have arithmetic operations performed on them -
for example, subtracting one similar image from another, then dividing
by the first image, will give an image denoting the difference betwen
the two images, expressed as a percentage.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="resources/capture9.png"><img
 alt="Rotations" title="Rotations" src="resources/capture9.png"
 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 402px; height: 200px;" hspace="3"
 vspace="3"></a><br>
</div>
Transformations can be edited using the Transform tool.&nbsp; The
example above shows a rotation about the Z axis, and the resulting
transformation matrix which may subsequently be saved and applied to
another volume.&nbsp; Saved transformations can also be edited using
this tool.<br>
<br>
<a href="resources/capture10.png"><img alt="Registration"
 title="Registration" src="resources/capture10.png"
 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 525px; height: 250px;" hspace="3"
 vspace="3"></a><br>
Registration between two image volumes can also be achieved using the
Transform tool.&nbsp; The example above shows point-matching
coregistration, where a coregistration matrix has been calculated from
identical landmark points placed by the user in two image
volumes.&nbsp; The transform can be defined as rigid, using 3 rotation
and 3 translation parameters, or as a 9- or 12-parameter nonrigid
transformation.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="performance"></a>Performance</h2>
<br>
<h2><a name="summary"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>
Mango is an exceptional program, well suited for a wide range of
applications.&nbsp; For the casual user it is a small, fast program
that can be used to view individual image files, or image volumes
stored in directories.&nbsp; More advanced users can use the volume and
surface rendering tools, <br>
